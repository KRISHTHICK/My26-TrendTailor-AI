# My26-TrendTailor-AI
GenAI

Here's a **brand new AI fashion project** idea with **full code, explanation**, and **no virtual environment** setup needed. It runs directly in **VS Code** and can be pushed to **GitHub**.

---

## 👗✨ Project Title: **TrendTailor AI – Outfit Matcher & Fashion Advice Generator**

### 💡 Idea:

**TrendTailor AI** helps users upload a clothing item (e.g., a top or pants) and then:

* Matches it with outfit suggestions from a local fashion dataset.
* Generates fashion advice (colors, patterns, occasions).
* Suggests similar trending items using local image similarity.

---

## 🎯 Features:

* 📸 Upload a single fashion item image.
* 🎨 Suggest outfit combinations (based on style matching).
* 🧠 Generate AI-powered fashion tips.
* 🔍 Find visually similar items using **cosine similarity**.
* 🌐 Optional: Link to online stores (mocked for demo).

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def extract_feature_vector(image, size=(100, 100)):
    img = image.resize(size).convert('L')
    return np.array(img).flatten().astype(np.float32)

def find_similar_outfits(uploaded_vec, folder="outfits"):
    results = []
    for file in os.listdir(folder):

## 🚀 `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
from utils import extract_feature_vector, find_similar_outfits, generate_fashion_advice

st.set_page_config(page_title="TrendTailor AI", layout="centered")
st.title("👗 TrendTailor AI – Outfit Matcher & Fashion Advice")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a fashion item image (top, jeans, etc.)", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])

if uploaded_file:
    img = Image.open(uploaded_file)
    st.image(img, caption="Uploaded Item", use_column_width=True)

    st.subheader("🔍 Finding Outfit Matches...")
    vec = extract_feature_vector(img)
    matches = find_similar_outfits(vec)

    for match_file, score in matches:
        st.image(f"outfits/{match_file}", caption=f"Match: {match_file} (Score: {round(score, 2)})")

    st.subheader("🧠 Fashion Advice")
    item_type = st.selectbox("Select the item category", ["Top", "Bottom", "Dress", "Jacket", "Other"])
    advice = generate_fashion_advice(item_type)

# 👗 TrendTailor AI – Outfit Matcher & Fashion Advisor

## 🎯 About
This is a fashion-focused AI app that:
- Matches uploaded clothing items with similar styles.
- Suggests styling tips based on clothing category.
- Uses basic computer vision (image feature vectors) to find matches.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
````

## 📂 Dataset

Add fashion item images to the `outfits/` folder. These act as the reference images for outfit matching.

## 🔧 Customize

* Add more tips in `utils.py`.
* Replace the similarity method with CLIP or MobileNet later.

## 💡 Inspiration

Designed for personal styling, e-commerce recommendations, or digital wardrobe assistants.

```

---

## 🧪 Sample Data
Add at least 5-10 images (e.g., `top1.jpg`, `pants1.jpg`, `jacket1.jpg`) to `outfits/` folder to test similarity and matching.

---

## ✅ How to Use in VS Code & GitHub
1. Clone the repo or create a folder and copy this code.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (no venv needed).
3. Run `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Upload your clothing item image.
5. View style matches and tips.
